##The two samples are small and not normally distributed. The correct test would include nonparametric test to compare outcomes between two independent groups. 
##The test to use is teh Mann Whitney U test (Assumptions: unequal groups, not normally distributed, unequal variances, small sample size, independent measurements)
##perform Mann Whitney U test between two groups
